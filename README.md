web app featuring a simple online quiz

Hi. 

This is a prototype of a simple web app featuring an online quiz, powered by JavaScript which dynamically updates the HTML and CSS. It is a series of multiple-choice questions. The current score as well as the highest scores will be stored.

This is a working version which shows basic functionality in terms of displaying the series of questions and multiple choice asnwers. Improvements on this project are ongoing and repository will be updated real time. 


Here is a sample view of the application:
