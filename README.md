# simple-web-quiz-app-prototype
web app featuring a simple online quiz

Hi. 

This is a prototype of a simple web app featuring an online quiz, powered by JavaScript which dynamically updates the HTML and CSS. It is a series of multiple-choice questions. The current score as well as the highest scores will be stored.

This is a (shomewhat) working version which shows basic functionality in terms of showing the questions and multiple choice asnwers. It forwards to the next set of questions and asnwers, but shows a glitch in setting the correct time and feedback display, which is still being worked on.  Improvements are underway and repository will be updated real time. 


Here is a sample view of the application:
